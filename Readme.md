### Fix errors before your users even notice them

[OhCrash](https://ohcrash.com) catches JavaScript errors and instantly opens nicely formed issues in the GitHub repository of your choice.


## How it works?

### 1. Set up OhCrash

Install ohcrash module via npm and initialize it using your API key.

### 2. Errors raised

Failures happen, there's no 100% protection for that.
But OhCrash helps you spot these errors by catching and reporting them.

### 3. Fix issues

As soon as error is caught, a new issue on GitHub will be opened will all related information (which you can customize).
